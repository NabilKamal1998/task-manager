# task-manager

**Project Description:**

The Java Task Manager Application is a software tool designed to help users manage their tasks efficiently. It provides a user-friendly interface for creating, tracking, and organizing tasks. The core functionality of this application revolves around a Task class, which represents tasks with name and description attributes.

**What i've done:**

I've created a Java Task Manager Application with a simple user interface and defined a Task class to represent tasks with name and description attributes.

**Next Steps - Adding more Features:**

Here are some next steps I'll be doing to to enhance the Task Manager Application project:

1. Task Deletion: Implement the ability to delete tasks from the list.

2. Task Editing: Allow users to edit existing tasks, including their names and descriptions.

3. Task Completion: Add a feature to mark tasks as completed or in-progress.

**Reflections:**

Understanding how to create a Java GUI was initially challenging but ultimately rewarding. I look forward to further exploring GUI development in Java, aiming to rely less on external assistance and gradually enhance my coding and logic skills.
